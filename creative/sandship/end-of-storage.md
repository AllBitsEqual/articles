# Sandship - End of Storage
A low and rhythmic humming fills the air, punctuated by the occasional banging of metal on metal and accompanied by the never-ending sounds of the tracks digging their way through the sand or Noranti. 

It is time. Time to check the storage facility display. Time to check if everything is in order. Booting up the holo card over his gauntlet,  Engineer scrolls through the entries, a smile slowly growing on his face... capped, capped, capped... all seems to be in order. Only this week the workers had finished the last upgrade of the prismatic tanks, causing the old oil refinery to start running again, churning out the harvest of time, pressure and heat in an endless stream of artificial oils. Then The Inker followed suit, crushing and mixing and mixing again. 

Engineer had checked every bottle, every crate filled with contained and coloured liquid and every row of stacks of crates, piling up to the ceiling of the storage ship.

A warning sound ruptured the train of thought as the holo card flared up red. "Out of Sync"... another data issue. He would have to check himself again. The server of Aya's NAS had sent corrupted data again. Engineer leaned back in his control room chair, linking up with one of the worker bots and bringing the HUD and camera display up in his view.

Slowly steering the irritated and rambling bot from Aya over to his storage ship and cursing the lunatic that had given these little buggers so much character and will, he forced his commands through the neural network of the bot and made him follow orders for a moment in silence. Once inside the container ship he checked the rows again, checked the crates and their labels until he had found what he was looking for. "Dark Purple - Ink - Glass Container" appeared in glowing colours over the runes on the storage unit. 

Everything seemed to be in order on the surface but his suspicion was confirmed when the bot reached the last row of this unit. 

One crate was partly open and the lid blocked the slot for the last crate... one was missing. Bickering again, as Engineers control over the bot had slipped in his annoyance, the little worker flew up to the highest crate and readjusted the lid, causing the holo card to update. No longer red for the error but blue was the display now and it only took a few minutes for another worker to fly through engineers limited remote vision only to place another crate in the now freed last spot.

This was it. The final crate, the final bottle, the final drop of ink. All done. All filled and all complete. Satisfied, Engineer unlinked from the bot and changed the selection on his holo card to the central control unit. Quickly he selected the factories on his visual grid, disabling them one by one, careful of the order, not to have anyone import line being filled by materials meant for storage. The mixers shut down first, followed by the refinery, followed by the bio lab and the liquids facility.

This was it. Finally... the endgame. He turned around in his seat and looked at all his control panels, the gauges, the meters, the diagnose outputs. All in order. With one swipe over the holo card, he sent out the order to disable all harvesters. Row by row, they shut down with a rumbling and the humming slowly faded away, fainter with every click and stuttering shutdown.

This was quiet, silence, equilibrium. He knew Harvey would come around soon with some ludicrous request again or remind him of the unfinished cooling units and melting ice blocks but whatever, Engineer had stashed those away out of sight for now. He could worry about that later. 

"Option 45 my ass, this body needs some rest!" were his last thoughts as he closed his eyes and dozed off in the emptiness of the now dimmed control room, with only the endless clatter and rumbling and creaking of the tracks in the sand, echoing through the empty halls and corridors of the sandship.

The Engineer sleeps but Aya is awake, on her miraculous journey through the neverending sand.
